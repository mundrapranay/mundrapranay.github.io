## Abstract
Large amounts of Open Data and large knowledge bases offer rich opportunities for data scientists, but come with big challenges due to the diverse, noisy and incomplete nature of this data eco-system. This paper proposes to pursue the paradigm of approximate query processing over Open Data, with focus on supporting analytic tasks that involve identifying relevant join paths and computing aggregations. We define the problem, outline a system architecture, and discuss approaches to taming the uncertainty and incompleteness of the underlying data.
