Hey! I'm Pranay Mundra, a Ph.D. Student at the Univeristy of Rochester, [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu) advised by [Professor Fatemeh Nargesian](https://fnargesian.com). 

## My Research
My primary research interests are Database Systems and Data-Centric Machine Learning. I enjoy working on problems related to data discovery and mining, such as minimizing data bias and enhancing data quality for machine learning. My current projects involve selecting coresets for large datasets so that we may train ML models on the coresets and achieve equal accuracy, hence lowering computational costs and increasing speed. I'm also working on a system that will enable for quick aggregate queries across vast knowledge graphs with missing values.

## My Background
I graduated from the [University of Washington](https://math.washington.edu) in Seattle with a B.Sc. in Mathematics. I worked on a variety of software engineering projects during the course of my four years, from research papers to side projects. [Maimon](https://mundrapranay.github.io/publication/2020-06-11-maimon), a framework that aids in approximating acyclic schema discovery from relations using Multivalued Dependencies, has been one of my main projects. Additionally, I've worked with [LightDB](https://github.com/uwdb/lightdb) and other Visual Database Management Systems. The [Caltech Tensorlab](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/group.html) is another place I've worked as a research intern. There, I researched how effectively the present neural network architecture can understand the compositional nature of data and helped develop a new architecture called [Tree Stack Memory Units](https://mundrapranay.github.io/publication/2019-11-05-treesmu).
