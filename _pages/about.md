Hey! I'm Pranay Mundra, a Ph.D. Student at the Univeristy of Rochester, [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu) advised currently by [Professor Fatemeh Nargesian](https://fnargesian.com). My office is in Room 2305 in [Wegmans Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/9m8kD2994LsTFfP2A). 

## Current Work
I am currently engaged as a visiting researcher at the [Paris Lodron Universität Salzburg Database Research Group](https://dbresearch.uni-salzburg.at) advised by [Professor Martin Schäler](https://dbresearch.uni-salzburg.at/people/schaeler). Together, we are spearheading the development of an alignment algorithm with the noble purpose of unveiling intricate language patterns and discerning semantic similarities within biblical texts spanning numerous languages and historical epochs. Additionally, I have been bestowed the honor of serving as a visiting researcher at the esteemed [MIT CSAIL Parallel Computing Group](https://toc.csail.mit.edu/Parallel_Computing), where I have the privilege of working with [Professor Quanquan Liu](https://quanquancliu.com/) and [Professor Julian Shun](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/index.shtml). In this project, we are working on an implementation of a pioneering benchmark suite that paves the way for distributed privacy-preserving locally adjustable graph algorithms.

## My Research
My main areas of interest are Database Systems, Machine Learning and Differential Privacy. I like working on data discovery and mining problems like minimizing data bias, improving data quality for machine learning, differential privacy systems, and query models. My current project involves selecting coresets for huge datasets in order to train ML models on the coresets with equivalent accuracy, lowering computational costs and enhancing speed. I'm also developing a solution that will allow for rapid aggregate queries over massive knowledge graphs with missing values. I also enjoy working on problems in number theory, group theory, probability, combinatronics, and graph theory with applications in computer science.

## My Background
I graduated from the [University of Washington](https://math.washington.edu) in Seattle with a B.Sc. in Mathematics. I worked on a variety of software engineering projects during the course of my four years, from research papers to side projects. [Maimon](https://mundrapranay.github.io/publication/2020-06-11-maimon), a framework that aids in approximating acyclic schema discovery from relations using Multivalued Dependencies, has been one of my main projects. Additionally, I've worked with [LightDB](https://github.com/uwdb/lightdb) and other Visual Database Management Systems. The [Caltech Tensorlab](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/group.html) is another place I've worked as a research intern. There, I researched how effectively the present neural network architecture can understand the compositional nature of data and helped develop a new architecture called [Tree Stack Memory Units](https://mundrapranay.github.io/publication/2019-11-05-treesmu).
