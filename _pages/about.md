Hey! I'm Pranay Mundra, a Ph.D. Student at the Univeristy of Rochester, [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu) advised by [Professor Fatemeh Nargesian](https://fnargesian.com). 

## My work and Research
I have worked on various software engineering projects, ranging from research papers to personal projects. My main focus areas are Database Systems and Machine Learning. One of my main projects has been Maimon, a system which comes up with acyclic schemas for a give relation. The paper for the project was accepted for the International Database Conference - SIGMOD 2020. I have also worked on Visual Database Management Systems, namely LightDB.
